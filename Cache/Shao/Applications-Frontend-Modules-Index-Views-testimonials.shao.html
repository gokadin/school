        <h4>Jennifer Livingston</h4>
        For 5 years I have been using a pen and paper for managing my
        music school business.<br />
        I was reluctant to work with a computer before,<br />
        but now I cannot see myself returning to my notebook!

        <h4>Alexa Deersen</h4>
        I am a martial arts teacher and I used to often forget<br />
        to tell all my students about upcoming activities.<br />
        Now that I use the computer to let them<br />
        know what's coming up, no one gets left behind!

        <h4>John Smith</h4>
        In the past, I have often lost track of the payments of<br />
        my students and was therefore obliged to ask them<br />
        when was the last time they paid me, which didn't seem<br />
        very professional. Since I started using this<br/>
        software to keep track of the payments, everything<br />
        goes smoothly.

        <h4>Simon Mononstein</h4>
        I have been running a small music business for<br />
        about 3 years now, but with all the students leaving<br />
        the country for vacation and the ones missing<br />
        classes because of sickness, it's hard to keep<br />
        track of who needs make up lessons. With the<br />
        calendar feature of this software, this problem is a<br />
        thing of the past!

        <h4>Alison Farmer</h4>
        I have been looking for a software packed with features <br/>
            without ridiculous pricing. Seems like I found it!
