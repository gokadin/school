            Can my students access the web site as well?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes. We offer many features that require your students
            to login.<br />
            For example we allow for students to pay for their tuition
            directly on the website.

            What is SSL encryption?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            It is a security measure that validates the identity of the website.<br />
            This way, a potential attacker might have a hard time posing itself as
            a certain wesbsite to steal your information.
